In this case, the target image has a different color tone, which gives it a sepia or vintage appearance.\n\n3. Determine the editing software or tools needed to achieve the desired result. In this case, the editing software used is Adobe Photoshop.\n\n4. Open the source image in Adobe Photoshop and create a new layer for the target image.\n\n5. Adjust the color balance of the source image to match the target image's sepia or vintage tone. This can be done by using the \"Hue/Saturation\" adjustment layer in Photoshop.\n\n6. Apply a sepia or vintage filter to the source image to give it the desired appearance. This can be done using the \"Filter\" menu in Photoshop and selecting the \"Colorize\" or \"Vintage\" filter.\n\n7. Adjust the filter settings to achieve the desired effect, such as the intensity, saturation, and hue.\n\n8.
