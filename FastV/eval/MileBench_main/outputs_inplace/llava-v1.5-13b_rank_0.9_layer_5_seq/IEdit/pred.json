Next, the software's color balance or color correction tool is used to adjust the colors in the image. This tool allows the user to selectively adjust the color balance of the image, such as increasing or decreasing the saturation, hue, and lightness of the colors.\n6. The user can experiment with different color balance settings until the desired color balance is achieved. This may involve increasing the saturation to make the colors more vivid, or decreasing the saturation to make the colors more subdued.\n7. Once the desired color balance is achieved, the user can save the image as a new file, with the same file name as the original source image, but with a different file extension, such as .jpg or .png.\n8.
